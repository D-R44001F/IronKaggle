# IronKaggle
For this project I trained a model using a large data set (640,000+ entries) to then make predictions on another data set. 

## In this Repository:
1. Sequential folder: contains the code for the sequential model, not used in the final model.
2. IronKaggle_2 contains the code for training the model and calculate the predictions as well as save the model and the resulting data set to a .csv file.

## Model used: XGBoost
Saved in file named xgboost_model_ironkaggle.json

Final results achieved by the model during training:
- RÂ²: 0.9370
- Mean Absolute Error: 652.9065
- Root Mean Squared Erro: 965.2988
